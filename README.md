# Ancient Battles
Two leaders go in, one leader comes out. Which pictured leader won the battle?

React / Redux / NodeJS / __ js web spider __ / __ js task runner __

Using Wikipedia battle entries, this app pulls a collection of battles that have all of the required details to be featured. It then shows the user just the pictures and names of the leaders of each side in the conflict. The user can request more details, such as year, and location of the battle, but must otherwise choose one leader that they think won the particular battle. They are told whether they were correct or not, and then can try again with a new battle.
